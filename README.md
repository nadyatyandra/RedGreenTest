# Red-green Test
"Red-green Test" was an application that could detect whether our eye requires optical correction through a red-green test. This application acts as a pre-test to diagnose common refractive defects (myopia and hypermetropia). The red-green test consists of several black shapes on a red and green background. If our eye requires optical correction, the shapes can stand out or look sharper on one of the colored backgrounds. This could happen due to the fact that red and green light rays donâ€™t fall in exactly the same place on the retina due to chromatic aberration. Green rays fall very slightly in front and red rays fall very slightly behind retina.
